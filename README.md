## Marfeel Tech Test

### Description

Replicated the screenshot as best as I could using only vanilla js, html and css.
In the end I decided against using the D3JS libary for the donut graphs. I felt that it was cleaner and less complex to use html canvas instead, considering that these graphs are fairly simple but I do see the usefulness of this library for more complex graphs and diagrams.
