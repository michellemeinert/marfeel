## Marfeel Tech Test

### Description

Replicated the screenshot as best as I could using only vanilla js, html and css.
I kept my code as simple and clean as possible while keeping it readable.
In the end I decided against using the D3JS libary for the donut graphs because I felt that it was cleaner and less complex to use html canvas for the simple graph instead but I do see the usefulness of this library for more complex graphs and diagrams.
